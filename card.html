			<p class="interesting-fact">Macaws live an average of 50 years, but can live up to 70 years if kept in captivity.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span>Average Lifespan</span>: 50 years</li>
				<li><span>Average Length</span>: 3.3 ft.</li>
				<li><span>Conservation Status</span>: Least Concern</li>
				<li><span>Habitat</span>: Rainforest</li>
			</ul>
			<p> Macaws are romantic and faithful. They are a monogamous species, this means that they only have one partner throughout their lives. The body language of these birds is very clear when they begin to form pairs: the duo separates from the others, they will begin to groom and feed each other and will have dilated pupils.</p>
